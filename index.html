        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Keanu Charles Reeves was born on september 2, 1964 in Beirut
              Lebanon
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              He lived in Sydney and New York before settling in Toronto, Canada
              at the age of six where Reeves spent the most of his formative
              years.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The actor struggled in school, even getting expelled from a
              performing arts school.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Reeves was reportedly about to start a career as a professional
              ice hockey player, but changed his mind after an injury and a trip
              to New York
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              After high school, the star took acting courses at night, then
              joined community theater productions and got an agent. His first
              professional roles was on a local Toronto television program
              called "Hanging In," where he played a "tough street kid."
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            But Reeves' big break arguably came in 1989, with "Bill & Ted's
            Excellent Adventure." Fresh off a role in period drama "Dangerous
            Liaisons," Reeves' turn as stoner genius Ted garnered him instant
            acclaim. Although "Bill & Ted" received mixed reviews, Reeves was
            generally praised for his performance, and the movie was a hit at
            the box office.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Reeves joined the alt-rock band Dogstar as a bassist in the early
              1990s, reportedly after an encounter with drummer Robert Mailhouse
              in a grocery store.

              In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star
              with the release of Speed (1994). After all this, Reeves did the
              unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck
              box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski
              siblings' cyberadventure, The Matrix (1999).

              The 1999 sci-fi action film "The Matrix" is arguably one of
              Reeves' most iconic movies. Directed by the Wachowskis, the film
              tells the story of a computer hacker enlisted to take down
              dystopian overlords. While subsequent spin-off films weren't as
              successful, "The Matrix" franchise made Reeves a household name.

              Reeves had said in a previous interview that he wanted to settle
              down and start a family at some point in his life, and in 1999,
              Syme became pregnant. Tragically, the couple's daughter, Ava
              Archer Syme-Reeves, was stillborn in December of that year. Syme
              reportedly experienced postpartum depression, and many believe
              that the grief the couple experienced due to the loss of their
              child led them to break up. However, they still remained friends
              up until Syme's death in April 2001. Reeves was due to begin
              shooting back-to-back "Matrix" sequels that spring, but took some
              time to grieve before resuming working.

              In 2011, Reeves started Arch motorcycle company with motorcycle
              designer Gard Hollinger, according to a recent GQ profile of
              Reeves. The company currently has a shop in Hawthorne, California,
              where Reeves can work on new designs.

              Keanu produced the 2012 documentary "Side by Side," which focused
              on the differences and history of both digital and photochemical
              film techniques.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In 2011, Reeves wrote "Ode to Happiness," an illustrated book that
              the Huffington Post called "a whimsical, humorous poetic riff on
              self-pity."
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              The 2014 action film "John Wick" was a surprising hit for Reeves
              both critically and commercially, and would go on to spawn two
              more sequels.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Huffington Post reports that Reeves "quietly" started a private
              cancer foundation in recent years, as a result of his sister Kim's
              10-year battle with leukemia.

              The actor also reportedly gave much of his earnings from the
              "Matrix" franchise to the special effects and design teams, and
              even gave stuntmen working on the films their own Harley Davidson
              motorcycles, according to Hello Magazine.
